# Contributor Cheatsheet

The Kubernetes project - of which Akash community groups (SIGs/Working Groups) and submission standards borrow heavily from - offers the following guidance for contributors.  While segments of this documentation are Kubernetes project specific, review of the standards and related submission guidance can be easily applied to the Akash project.

Consider review of the following resources:

* [Contributor Cheatsheet](https://www.kubernetes.dev/docs/contributor-cheatsheet/) - provides the contributor guidance on aspects such as proper issue/pull request creation standards/expectations, branch strategies, etc

* [New Contributor Course](https://www.kubernetes.dev/docs/onboarding/) - while some content is very Kubernetes project specific the course is an excellent resource for any project and those not yet familiar with contributing to an open source project
